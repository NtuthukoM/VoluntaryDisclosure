            <p>
                Thank you for meeting with us to discuss your career goals and potential future growth at Dariel.
                As a consulting business, our people often have to work in highly regulated industries.
                As such, we need to know if there are any potential blockers to you working in certain industries or for certain businesses.
                We'd like to ask you to disclose or confirm a couple of things before we get too far into our process so we can address and hopefully overcome them early:                
            </p>
